    content: It became the highlight of my day, to be honest.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: And then I'd be catching myself pointing these things out around Claire
      and Mike.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: Hell, I didn't even notice until they started poking fun at me, Claire
      kept calling me your superfan.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: But then of course Claire started getting really invested, and she was
      always asking you all these questions about your stories.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: And I caught Mike trying to draw one of your characters in class.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: So they really turned out to be bigger fans than I was, huh?
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: Funny thing too, sometimes you'd say a word, and I'd have no idea what
      it meant,
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: and I didn't wanna look dumb in front of you, so I'd go and ask Claire
      what it meant.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: I think she started getting annoyed so I asked Mike instead.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: But then he'd go ask her, and then we'd be back at square one.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: I think I did it too much. I'm sorry about that.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: But I swear, I'd learn it, and then I'd come to class and I'd mention
      it, and by god,
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: your eyes would just light up.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: I never really saw what those little moments meant back then, but I
      get it now.
  - avatarName: NONE
    content: I just wish you were here so I could tell you.
